# GlobalAid Connect

Hey there! 👋

So I built this website because I wanted to make it easier for people to find and donate to organizations that are actually making a difference in the world.

## 🚨 Important - Please Read This First

**I'm not making any money from this.** 

Seriously. When you click those donation buttons, you go straight to the organization's official website. I don't touch your donation, I don't take a cut, I don't get any commission. Nothing. Zero. Zilch.

This is just a directory I made to help connect people with these amazing charities. That's it.

## 💭 Why I Made This

Honestly? I was looking for good organizations to donate to and thought "man, it would be nice to have them all in one place with clear info about what they do." So I built this site.

No fancy business model. No hidden agenda. Just trying to help.

## 🏥 The Organizations

I picked these five because they're legit, they've been around for decades, and they actually do good work:

1. **Doctors Without Borders (MSF)** - They go into war zones and disaster areas to help people. Like, actually into the dangerous places.

2. **WaterAid** - Getting clean water to people who don't have it. Seems basic but it's literally life-changing.

3. **CARE International** - Fighting poverty, especially helping women and girls get education and opportunities.

4. **Oxfam** - Working on inequality and getting food/water/help to people in crisis.

5. **BRAC** - Huge organization doing education, healthcare, and helping people escape poverty.

These aren't the only good charities out there, but they're a solid starting point.

## 🤷 How This Works

1. You visit this website
2. You read about the organizations
3. You click a "Donate" button
4. You go to THEIR official website
5. You donate directly to THEM

I never see your money. I never see your information. I'm literally just pointing you to their websites.

## 🔒 Your Privacy

I don't collect your data. No cookies, no tracking, no analytics, no weird stuff. 

When you leave this site and go to donate, you're on their website following their rules and privacy policies. I have nothing to do with that part.

## 💻 Technical Stuff

It's just a single HTML file. No complicated setup, no database, no backend. You can literally just download it and open it in your browser.

Want to host it yourself? Go ahead! Put it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, wherever. It's free to use.

## 🎨 Want to Change Something?

Feel free! The code is pretty straightforward. If you want to:
- Change the colors
- Add more organizations
- Translate it to another language
- Whatever else

Go for it. Just keep it honest and don't try to scam people.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer Stuff

Look, I have to say this: I'm not affiliated with any of these organizations. They don't know I made this site. If you have questions about your donation, contact them directly, not me.

Also, organizations sometimes change their websites or donation links. If you notice something's broken, let me know and I'll fix it.

## 🤝 Want to Help?

Cool! Here's what would be helpful:
- Tell me if any links are broken
- Suggest other trustworthy organizations to add
- Let me know if something's confusing
- Fix typos (I probably made some)

Just keep in mind the whole point is to help people donate, not to make money or do anything sketchy.

## 📧 Questions?

If you have questions or want to reach out, you can find my contact info in the website footer. Or I have my personal website aadim-alt.github.io/web contact me from here.

But again - if you have questions about your actual DONATION, contact the charity directly. I can't help with that since I'm not involved in the donation process at all.

## 🙏 Final Thoughts

If you're thinking about donating, that's awesome. These organizations do incredible work and they need support.

Even small donations help. Like, genuinely. Don't feel like you need to give a huge amount. Every bit counts.

And if you can't donate right now, that's totally fine too. Maybe share this with someone who might be interested, or just keep these organizations in mind for later.

Thanks for checking this out. ❤️

**One More Time Because It's Important:**

I don't make money from this website. All donations go directly to the organizations. I'm just a person who made a website to help connect donors with charities. That's the whole story.
